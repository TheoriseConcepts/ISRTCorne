A beginners foray into the world of split custom keyboards.

![FINISHED-BUILD](https://github.com/theoriseconcepts/ISRTCorne/branch/main/images/finished-build.jpg)

This keyboard was created from a desire to break away from the norm and to try new and interesting projects. Passion is born from exploring the unknown and from not being afraid to take that first step. There are many guides out there to propel you through your journey into custom keyboards, but I shall endeavour to layout my experiences here.

Interested in the components I used? See the [parts list](https://github.com/theoriseconcepts/ISRTCorne/branch/main/doc/partslist.md) for details and buying recommendations.

I'll walkthrough a simple [build guide](https://github.com/theoriseconcepts/ISRTCorne/branch/main/doc/buildguide.md) and tips I have for assembly. I'll also mention issues I encountered during the build process and how I resolved them.

Curious about my custom keycaps? Here is the method I used for [dye sublimation](https://github.com/theoriseconcepts/ISRTCorne/branch/main/doc/dyesublimation.md).

See the [firmware guide](https://github.com/theoriseconcepts/ISRTCorne/branch/main/doc/firmwareguide.md) for how to generate ZMK firmware and customise your keyboard layout. QMK and vial support is also available however I won't detail those methods here.
