Do you struggle with touch typing and want a useful visual reminder for your new split keyboard layout? Then you've come to the right place. Let me walk you through the method I found and adapted to print my keyboard layout onto my keycaps.

# Print Icons

1. Open my [example sheet](https://github.com/theoriseconcepts/ISRTCorne/blob/main/doc/images/dyesub.svg) in a program like Inkscape and edit the images and paper size as you desire.
2. Mirror the image and either follow a guide to make your own dye sublimation printer, or order from an online service.
3. Cut out your icons to the appropriate keycap size.

# Transfer to Keycaps

1. Cut a small piece of tape and put it on the back of the icon.
2. Tape the icon to the keycap.
3. Turn on the flat iron.
4. Prepare a timer for 1 minute 45 seconds.
5. Put the keycap in the heat press and either use a clamp or oven mitts to press firmly.
6. Start the timer for 1 minute 45 seconds.
7. Take out the keycap (careful it's hot!).
8. Repeat this process for every keycap.
